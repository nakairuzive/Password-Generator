# 🔐 Password Generator App
If you remember using the internet in the 2000's and the early 2010's, you remember the struggle of having to scratch your brain to come up with 
a strong password and then having to write it down on a Post-it that would eventually get lost. You would then have to request a password, and the 
cycle repeats itself.
Thankfully, most modern browsers have a wonderful feature that suggests a secure password whenever you need to sign up or sign in to an account. Its magical, isn't it??
Luckily its not that complicated, these passwords are generated by a math function that randomly puts together different combinations of letters, symbols and numbers.
This project explores how you can create your own password generator.
## 🪛 Technologies 
+ CSS
+ HTML
+ JavaScript
## 🎮 Features
+ "Click to Copy" passwords
+ Settings menu, includes
  + Set password length
  + On/Off switch for symbols
  + On/Off switch for numbers
## 🏗️ The Process
+ Start with the HTML skeleton to set the foundation and also to ensure that all the features are accounted for
+ Ensure that you give all your elements names that make sense and that you will remember the purpose of when coding in JavaScript
+ Do the basic styling in CSS, don't waste your brain power trying to figure out your colour schemes, you can do that at the end.
+ In JavaScript
  + Set up all the variables; these must be linked to the elements in the document (index.html)
  + Create arrays to store your characters, numbers, letters and symbols
  + You can use this to help you, you're welcome (˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶)
  + ```const characters = ["A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K","L","M","N","O","P","Q","R","S","T","U","V","W","X","Y","Z","a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l","m","n","o","p","q","r","s","t","u","v","w","x","y","z", "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9","~","`","!","@","#","$","%","^","&","*","(",")","_","-","+","=","{","[","}","]",",","|",":",";","<",">",".","?",
"/"]; ```
  + Code the functions that will generate the passwords
  + Hint: Research how to use Math.floor(Math.random())
  + Assign events to all the buttons
## 👨🏻‍🏫 What I learned
+ Plan the logic of your functions before you start coding, and carefully think about what you want them to do. I experienced a lot of confusion that could have been avoided if I planned first.
+ Functionality >> Aesthetics. Its more important that the program is working that it being pretty and not working. That's the reason why I suggested you shoul rather work on the JavaScript before going heavy on the styling in CSS
 
## 💡 What can be improved
+ The styling can be modernised
+ The blocks where the passwords are displayed can be set to {display: flex} so that they can be placed side by side. When the passwords become too long, they display boxes that should stack on top of each other
+ Naming Conventions
